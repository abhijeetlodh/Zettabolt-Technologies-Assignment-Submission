ethics
main article: ethics of artificial intelligence
ai has potential benefits and potential risks. ai may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: demis hassabis of deepmind hopes to "solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else". however, as the use of ai has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. in-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their ai training processes, especially when the ai algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.
